# Boiler Plate for Flask, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow-Flask, and Flask-Migrate

This project serves as a boilerplate for building scalable web applications using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow-Flask, and Flask-Migrate. It is designed to kickstart development by providing a structured framework that includes user authentication, database migrations, and API documentation using Swagger.

## **Installation**

### **Option 1: Using a Virtual Environment**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```sh
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### **Option 2: Using Docker**

1. Build the Docker image from the provided Dockerfile:

    ```sh
    docker build -t <image tag> .
    ```
2. Run the Docker container:

    ```sh
    docker run -p 5000:5000 <image name, tag, or id>
    ```

## **Usage**

Once the Flask app is running, you can explore and interact with the API documentation in Swagger by navigating to:

```http://0.0.0.0:5000/docs```

## **Features**

- **User Authentication**: Implement user signup, login, and logout functionalities.
- **Database Migrations**: Easily manage database schema changes using Flask-Migrate.
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated API documentation with Swagger UI.
- **Environment Configuration**: Manage application settings securely using environment variables.

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Implement your changes.
4. Write or update tests as necessary.
5. Submit a pull request against the main branch.

Please ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.
